    <br>
    <p>This is a different potato salad for those who don't want a mayonnaise-based recipe.
         My family has enjoyed this for many years, and it is easy to adapt by adding more spices that suit your family.</p>
    <p>This recipe makes 5 servings and takes about 35 minutes to make.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Here's what you need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>8 white potatoes, peeled and cut into cubes</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dry mustard</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup cider vinegar, divided</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Directions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. 
            Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until just tender, about 15 minutes; drain</li>
        <li>Put potatoes into a large bowl; add onion and stir</li>
        <li>Mix sugar, mustard, and salt together in a bowl. Stir just enough vinegar into the sugar mixture to form a paste; season with black pepper</li>
        <li>Whisk remaining vinegar and vegetable oil together in a separate bowl until smooth; stream into bowl with the paste, whisking continually to incorporate. 
            Pour the dressing over the potato and onion mixture</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let salad cool slightly, 5 to 10 minutes</li>
    </ol>
